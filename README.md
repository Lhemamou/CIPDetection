# 🌟 CIPDetection - An easy tool for CIP code pharmacy extraction 🌟

## 📋 Overview
The CIP code or Presentation Identifying Code is a 7 or 13 digit numerical code used to identify a presentation (or packaging) of a medication [see here](https://sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/medicaments/glossaire/article/code-cip). Occasionally, during email exchanges, numerous available CIP products are communicated in an unstructured text format, making it challenging to import them into databases. We have developed this tool to facilitate the easy import of these products.

## ✨ Key Features
